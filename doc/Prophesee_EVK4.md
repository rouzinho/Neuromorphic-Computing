# Prophesee EVK4

Introduce EVK4, point to doc, setup example by changing bias etc...
include use with kinect.
recording datas. getting right format.

## Introduction and setup

The Prophesee EVK4 is a dynamic vision sensor that delivers events when a change of brightness occurs. More precisely, ON and OFF events are generated when the brigthness rises or lowers respectively. It can generate events on a scale of nanoseconds and has a resolution of 1280x720. The installation and setup can be found on the Prophesee [website](https://docs.prophesee.ai/stable/get_started/index.html)

In our case, we will use a robotic setup where the camera is mounted on top of a table with a robotic arm in sight. The purpose is to observe objects moving and combine the events generated by the EVK4 with a Kinect depth camera to perform sensor fusion.

## Tuning Bias

The most important parameters to consider in order to calibrate the camera to your environment are the [bias](https://docs.prophesee.ai/stable/hw/manuals/biases.html#chapter-biases). A well calibrated camera can make a tremondous difference in the quality of the datas generated. Here, you can see the difference before tuning the bias and after :
