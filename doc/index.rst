Welcome to Neuromorphic Computing with Cameras.
===================================

The point of this documentation is to describe and provide examples on how to use a depth camera and a dynamic vision sensor. In addition, the documentation introduces the use of
 neuromorphic hardware to compute data generated by the different cameras.
The general purpose of the project is to showcase the benefits of using a dynamic vision sensor as well as the processing of events on neuromorphic hardware.
